            <p class="intro-paragraph"> From the early age of five, it was obvious that Vladimir Omeltchenko was exceptionally gifted. 
                His mother was a Professor of Language and Literature, and his father was a pilot. It was his mother’s dream however, for Vladimir 
                to pursue music, so his parents decided to enroll him at a special music school in Yekaterinburg, Russia, where he spent twelve 
                years as a student of Lev Mirchin. Vladimir continued his studies at the Ural State Conservatory, leading three orchestras and winning 
                a number of competitions. Upon graduating, Vladimir was invited to stay on as Professor there.

                    <p class="instrument-description">Ever since my childhood, I have loved to listen to the sounds of nature; birdsong, the rustling of leaves and the murmur of streams. 
                        The natural world awakened in me the appreciation of stillness, peace and tranquillity. “Listen to the silence, and you will hear the voice of the universe” is a 
                        quote I have long held dear.  Its lasting impression manifested itself in my compositions. Long before I learned to read music, I would spend my hours improvising, 
                        transcribing symphonies to whichever instrument was to hand.</p>
